# Question

Look at this `break` statement:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i > 7) break;
  console.log(i);
}
```

Is there any way we could achieve the exact same functionality with a `for` loop, but _without_ using the `break` statement?

# Answer

If we wanted to achieve the exact same functionality with a `for` loop, but _without_ using the `break` statement, we would change `i < 10` to `i <= 7`, it would look like this :

```js
for (let i = 0; i <= 7; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```
